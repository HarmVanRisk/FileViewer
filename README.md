# FileViewer
###### Mac app NSTableView tutorial that makes a basic file viewer

The reason behind me creating this is I wanted to learn more about building mac apps, specifically interaction with NSTableViews, so I can improve on my iOS development knowledge.
This project follows the raywenderlich.com tutorial [macOS NSTableTutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/830-macos-nstableview-tutorial) where we create a very basic app that displays the contents of a folder.
Topics covered:
- Populating a table view
- Changing it's visual stye
- React to user interaction like selections, double clicks and sorting
